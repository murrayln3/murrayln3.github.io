This page is dedicated to my sweet girl Quinn! I rescued her some people in my howetown who didn't take very good care of her. I have had her for about a year, and she is 1.5 years old now. She is a black and tan and english coonhound mix, and she is a sweet little angel baby! Please scroll through my page to see how cute and funny she is.
